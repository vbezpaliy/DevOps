SFTP server

Configure SSH Daemon If you have not done so yet, install SSH server:

$ sudo apt install ssh

Next, In order to configure FTP over OpenSSH server use your favorite text editor to edit existing SSHD 
configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

and append the following to the end of the file:

Match group sftp ChrootDirectory /home X11Forwarding no AllowTcpForwarding no ForceCommand internal-sftp

Restart SSH server to apply new changes:

$ sudo service ssh restart

Create SFTP user account We are almost done. All that remains is to create a new user account specific to SFTP service. 
Let's start by creating a new group called sftp:

$ sudo addgroup sftp Adding group `sftp' (GID 1001) ... Done.

Next, create a new user eg. sftpuser and assign him to the previously created sftp group:

$ sudo useradd -m sftpuser -g sftp

Set a new password for the sftpuser user:

$ sudo passwd sftpuser Enter new UNIX password: Retype new UNIX password: passwd: password updated successfully

Lastly, change access permissions to the user's home directly to deny access to it to any other users on the same system:

$ sudo chmod 700 /home/sftpuser/

All done. User login via SFTP Our new user with username sftpuser is now ready to login to our new S
FTP server via sftp:// protocol. Given that your new SFTP server can be resolved via eg. 
hostname ubuntu-sftp use sftp command to create a new SFTP connection:

$ sftp sftpuser@ubuntu-sftp The authenticity of host 'ubuntu-sftp (10.1.1.4)' can't be established. 
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:8SSv/iz6OGaF8m0TLcJNtRSitfTm59dOVa57WnRfUx8. Are you sure you want to 
continue connecting (yes/no)? yes Warning: Permanently added 'ubuntu-sftp' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts. sftpuser@ubuntu-sftp's password: Connected to ubuntu-sftp. sftp>

Navigate to your home directory and confirm write access by creating a new directory:

sftp> cd sftpuser sftp> mkdir sftp-test sftp> ls examples.desktop sftp-test
sftp>

Another alternative is to make a SFTP connection using any GUI FTP client. 
The simplest could be to use a Nautilus file manager which should be already installed on your system:
